                                                adults. With a lot of first-time car buyers, “it’s not that they have

                                                    route, since you can pay for the car over time without paying too

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">To get the best price on your car, you need to shop around.
                                But that doesn’t mean you have to spend countless weekends dealership
                                hopping.</span><br>
                            <strong></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Use the internet department: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">Most dealerships
                                have internet departments&nbsp;—&nbsp; employees able to price, negotiate and finance
                                cars via phone, email or text messages.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">This means
                                you can go to one lot to test-drive your desired cars, then go home and </span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400">email multiple dealerships for price quotes</span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
                        <p><strong>Survey your options:&nbsp;</strong>You don’t have to buy or even discuss pricing with
                            the salesperson the first time you visit the dealership. And, in fact, you shouldn’t try to
                            handle it all in one day, says Ron Montoya, a senior consumer advice editor at Edmunds:
                            “You’re not going to have the ability to shop that price around, to see what other options
                            you have.”</p>
                    </div>

                <h3>How do I negotiate?</h3>
                <div>
                    <div class="textwidget">
                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot of first-time buyers are understandably nervous about
                                negotiating</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><span
                                style="font-weight: 400">but there are ways to safeguard yourself. </span><br>
                            <strong></strong>
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Focus on the total price:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Never tell the
                                dealer, ‘This is how much I want to pay per month,’” cautions Muller. You risk being
                                seduced by lower monthly payments, but winding up with a long loan term and extra
                                interest. Instead, negotiate on the car’s total price.</span></p>
                        <p><strong>Take your time:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-weight: 400">You might not enjoy
                                haggling over the price of your new ride, but rushing through it could result in a bad
                                deal. Take as much time and care as you need. “Keep in mind: A&nbsp;dealer has to sell a
                                car, you don’t have to buy,” Hall says. “Don’t be afraid to sleep on it. Don’t be afraid
                                to go grab some lunch and think on it. Don’t let the dealer pressure you.”</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closing a deal with a private seller is simple. Just check
                                with your state’s department of motor vehicles to see what paperwork you need.
                            </span><span style="font-weight: 400">At a dealership, the finance and insurance manager
                                handles the paperwork — and the closing is a bit more involved. Dealerships often try to
                                build extra profit into the deal. Be on the lookout for:</span><br>

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Extended warranties: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400">Most new cars come with
                                a three-year/36,000-mile bumper-to-bumper warranty or a powertrain warranty for up to
                                60,000 miles.&nbsp;</span>At the dealership, the finance manager may push an extended
                            warranty. These can offer peace of mind by eliminating the costs of unexpected repairs, but
                            why buy something now that you won’t need for another three years? You can always buy one
                            later.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bogus fees:</strong>&nbsp;Your sales contract will show the price of the car, state
                            and local taxes, a documentation fee and registration fees. If you see additional fees,
                            ask&nbsp;the finance manager to justify them — and don’t pay any extra costs&nbsp;he or she
                            can’t explain.</p>
